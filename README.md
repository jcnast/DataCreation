# DataCreation
simple data and class creation project (to be used in tandem with the application project)

This (for now) uses a simple SQLite database to store data and create the corresponding data structs (for c++ at least).

I am also going to use this, in tandem with ASSIMP, to load, modify, and export assets.

This will be the main data point for further progress in the Application project.
